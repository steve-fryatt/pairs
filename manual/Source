<chapter title="Credits" file="Credits">

<cite>Pairs</cite> uses <cite>PlayIt</cite>, originally by Rick Hudson and now maintained by Chris Martin, to play sound samples. This is Freeware and can be obtained from Chris Martin&rsquo;s website at <link ref="#url">http://www.users.on.net/~belles/software/playit/</link>.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Introduction" file="Introduction">

<cite>Pairs</cite> is a Desktop memory game. The playing area is covered in pairs of picture cards, placed face down. Each player takes it in turns to flip over two cards and look at the pictures. If they match, the cards are removed and the player gets another turn; the winner is the player to have removed the most pairs of cards at the end of the game.

Interactive help is fully supported.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Installing Pairs" file="Install">

<cite>Pairs</cite> requires RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.1 or later and has been tested on RISC&nbsp;OS Select (RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;4.33). It is 32-bit compliant and compatible with RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;5 on the Iyonix and its successors.

<cite>Pairs</cite> can be run off a hard disc or floppy disc. To install it on a hard disc, copy the <file>!Pairs</file> application to a suitable place on your disc. If sound samples are used, use from a floppy disc may be impractical due to space limitations.

<cite>Pairs</cite> uses Rick Hudson&rsquo;s <cite>PlayIt</cite> &ndash; now maintained by Chris Martin &ndash; to handle sound samples. The latest version of this is can be obtained from Chris&rsquo;s website at <link ref="#url">http://www.users.on.net/~belles/software/playit/</link>. Versions from 1.68 onwards are 32-bit clean. <cite>Pairs</cite> requires version 1.59 or later.

The <file>!PlayIt</file> application should be copied into <file>!Boot.Resources</file>, so that it can be found by any applications that need it. Full documentation is supplied in the <cite>PlayIt</cite> archive. If you do not wish to use sound, installing <cite>PlayIt</cite> is not necessary.

<subhead title="Upgrading from version 0.20 or earlier">

If you are upgrading <cite>Pairs</cite> from version 0.20 or earlier, you will need to update the structure of the <file>!Pairs.Cards</file> directory. Card sets are now stored in their own sub-directories, to allow for the storage of sound samples.

Open the <file>Cards</file> directory (<key>shift</key>-double-click on <file>!Pairs</file> to open the application directory). It will contain sprite files that correspond to the various installed card sets: these will have the names of the card sets, with optional &ldquo;22&rdquo; and &ldquo;23&rdquo; suffixes.

For each set of card sprites in turn, rename the file with <em>no</em> suffix (for example, <file>Pictures</file>) as <file>Sprites</file>. Then create a directory with the original name inside <file>!Pairs.Cards</file> and move the renamed sprite file into it. If there are files with the same name and either &ldquo;22&rdquo; or &ldquo;23&rdquo; suffixes, rename them as <file>Sprites22</file> and <file>Sprites23</file> respectively and move them into the directory too (it is very unlikely that there will be any &ldquo;23&rdquo; files present). Repeat this process until there are no sprite files in the root <file>!Pairs.Cards</file> directory.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Using Pairs" file="Use">

Put <cite>Pairs</cite> on to the iconbar by double-clicking on the <file>!Pairs</file> application in a Filer window. To start a new game using the default options, click <mouse>select</mouse> on its iconbar icon to open the playing window.

The human player moves first against the computer, so click <mouse>select</mouse> on any two of the cards to turn them over. Look at the pictures and try to remember what they are. After a short pause the cards are flipped back again and the computer will turn over two cards of its own; again, watch what the cards are and try to remember them.

If either player turns over a pair of cards, the cards are removed from play and that player gets another turn. At the end of the game, the winner is the one to find the most pairs.

The current scores are shown at the top of the playing window, alongside the players&rsquo; names. To change the name of the human player, click over the name and enter a new one in the field that appears. Press <key>return</key> to change the name or <key>escape</key> to cancel. Editing the name of the computer player can be enabled from the <link ref="Options">Choices Window</link>, or editing the human player&rsquo;s name can be disabled.

To start a new game, click <mouse>menu</mouse> over the game board and select <menu>New game</menu>.


<subhead title="Game Statistics">

A few more statistics are available, to indicate how the current game is progressing. Select <menu>Statistics...</menu> from the icon bar menu to open the <window>Game Statistics</window> window.

This window contains the game scores for each player, as shown in the playing window. It also contains the largest number of attempts taken to turn over a pair of cards, as well as the average number of attempts. Finally, the total number of turns taken is shown.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Game Options" file="Options">

The various game options can be set from the <window>Choices Window</window>, by choosing <menu>Choices...</menu> from the icon bar menu. The options set here will take effect in the next new game to be started and do not affect any game that is currently in progress.

The <icon>Players</icon> section allows details of the two players to be set. The names of the human and computer players can be entered here; if the <icon>Editable</icon> option is on, they can then be changed from the game window as described above.

The <icon>Forgetfulness</icon> option for the computer player sets its playing level. In each round it will forget a certain percentage of what it knows: the higher the percentage, the weaker it plays. At 100% its game play is totally random, at 0% it will never forget any cards it sees. It can be surprising how high this must be set for the human player to have any chance of winning...

<icon>Board</icon> allows the playing board to be set up. The <icon>Card set</icon> menu selects the card sprites to be used. The rows and columns (and hence the total number of cards) is set by the <icon>Size</icon> fields. Use the bump icons to change the values, but note that if one dimension is an odd number, the other can only be set to even numbers to ensure an even number of cards (and hence a full set of pairs). Finally, <icon>Different cards</icon> sets the number of different images used.

The <icon>Play</icon> section allows the length of time the cards are turned over for to be adjusted. The value shown is in half-seconds. If a suitable version of <cite>PlayIt</cite> is installed and has been seen, selecting the <icon>Use sounds</icon> option will cause the card sounds to be played if available.

Click <mouse>select</mouse> on <icon>Apply</icon> to use the changes or on <icon>Cancel</icon> to forget them. <icon>Save</icon> will use the changes and save them so that they will be used in future too. Clicking with <mouse>adjust</mouse> will leave the window open; with <icon>Cancel</icon> this resets the values in the window to the state they were in when it was opened.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Designing New Card Sets" file="Cards">

To add to the selection of cards available, <key>shift</key>-double-click on <file>!Pairs</file> and open the <file>Cards</file> directory. This holds the sprite files and sounds used for the card sets. Each set of cards is stored in a separate directory; the name of the directory is used to identify the cards within the application.

The directory for each set contains a sprite file holding the images of the cards, with one sprite per card. To create different versions of a card set for low and high resolution modes (mode&nbsp;12 and mode&nbsp;27), use the standard Wimp sprite name suffixes to differentiate the files. The low res file should be called <file>Sprites</file> and the high res set <file>Sprites22</file> (if you create a high-res mono set, call it <file>Sprites23</file>). If you don&rsquo;t create a set of low-res sprites, don&rsquo;t bother with the number suffix.

The sprite files should each contain a set of sprites, one for each card, named from &ldquo;0&rdquo; to &ldquo;31&rdquo; (if fewer images are created, the file will still work, but fewer different cards can be used in the game). An additional sprite named &ldquo;null&rdquo; must also be included, which is used for the backs of the cards.

The sprites can be any size and colour depth, although bear in mind the practicality of using the cards (particularly on low-res monitors). The dimensions of the card set, used for laying out the playing grid, are taken from the &ldquo;null&rdquo; sprite. For this reason, all the cards should have the same dimensions as the &ldquo;null&rdquo; sprite.

To use images derived from other formats (such as JPEGs), use ChangeFSI to convert the images into sprites and then use Paint to merge them into a single sprite file and adjust the image names accordingly.


<subhead title="Adding sounds">

To add sounds to the card set, create a directory within the card set directory called <file>Sounds</file>. This directory should contain a set of sound samples. Each card gets a file; the names of the files should match the sprite names in the sprites file.

The formats that can be used for the sound samples are anything that <cite>PlayIt</cite> can support. See the <cite>PlayIt</cite> documentation for more details.

If you design any new sets of cards that you think others could make use of, I would be happy to include them in the <cite>Pairs</cite> distribution.
